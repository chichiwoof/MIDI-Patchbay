This directory is being used to develop and test a menu system for the LCD.

It uses a regular desktop development environment rather than targetting 
the Arduino.  This makes developing, testing and debugging considerably
easier. 

When it's nearing completion the code will be moved/merged into the 
formware/MIDI-Patchbay directory.
