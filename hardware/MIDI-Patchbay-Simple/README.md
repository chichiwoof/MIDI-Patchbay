# MIDI-Patchbay-Simple

This directory contains the schematic and board layout for the
predecessor/prototype of the [MIDI Patchbay Shield](../MIDI-Patchbay-Shield) for the Arduino MEGA 2560.

This is a simple 4 MIDI IN / 4 MIDI OUT merger and splitter.

The [MIDI Patchbay Shield](../MIDI-Patchbay-Shield)
is the newer design with more functionality, but if you want something
simple and slightly easier/cheaper/quicker to build then this might be
the droids you're looking for.
