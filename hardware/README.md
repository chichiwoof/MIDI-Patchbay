This directory contains the schematics and circuit board layouts for

* [MIDI-Patchbay-Shield](MIDI-Patchbay-Shield) adds MIDI IN/OUT
functionality to an Arduino MEGA 2560, along with connectors for
the optional [MIDI-Patchbay-Display](MIDI-Patchbay-Display) and
access to digital and analog pins for adding further switches,
potentiometers, etc.

* [MIDI-Patchbay-Display](MIDI-Patchbay-Display) is an optional extra
for mounting an LCD display and rotary encoders.  This is used in
conjunction with the [MIDI-Patchbay-Shield](MIDI-Patchbay-Shield).

* [MIDI-Patchbay-Simple](MIDI-Patchbay-Simple) is the predecessor to
[MIDI-Patchbay-Shield](MIDI-Patchbay-Shield).  It's an older and slightly
simpler version (e.g. no support for displays or rotary encoders), so
good if you just want a basic MIDI merger/splitter unit, or perhaps
something to adapt for your own project.
